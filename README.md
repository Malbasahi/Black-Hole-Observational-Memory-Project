## Overview

Can a present-day observation of a black hole retain information about events that occurred in its past?

This project introduces the concept of **Observational Memory** and investigates whether observable black-hole structures preserve recoverable information about prior physical events.

Using synthetic simulations, deep learning, morphology analysis, GRMHD-inspired bridge datasets, Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations, and external validation, the project studies how information persists and degrades across different observational regimes.

---

## Main Research Question

> Can black-hole observations retain recoverable information about past events, and what aspects of that information remain observable over time?

The project investigates:

* What happened?
* When did it happen?
* How long does the information remain observable?

---

## Key Concepts

### Observational Memory

Information about past physical events encoded within a current observation.

### Event Identity

Information describing **what happened**.

Examples:

* Accretion burst
* Jet eruption
* Turbulence spike
* Spin transition

### Event Timing

Information describing **when the event occurred**.

### Memory Persistence

The duration over which event information remains recoverable.

### Memory Horizon

The maximum timescale over which information remains observable.

---

## Main Results

### Event Identity Remains Recoverable

Across multiple experiments, event identity remained partially recoverable from observations.

### Event Timing Is Much Harder

Event timing consistently proved more difficult to recover than event identity.

### Observation Timing Matters More Than Model Complexity

Event-centered observations substantially improved recoverability, while late-stage observations provided limited additional information.

### Synthetic-to-Real Consistency Exists

Real EHT observations consistently aligned with a GRMHD-inspired synthetic bridge domain.

### Expanded External Validation Passed

Phase 8-A achieved:

PASS
Bridge Consistency Score = 1.0
```

with all major validation layers identifying the same bridge domain.

## Final Scientific Finding

The strongest supported conclusion of the project is:

> Real EHT observations consistently occupy regions of morphology and latent space most closely associated with a GRMHD-inspired synthetic bridge domain. This relationship survives calibration, robustness testing, analogue mapping, metadata reconstruction, and expanded external validation.

---

## What This Project Does NOT Claim

The project does **not** claim:

* Recovery of true black-hole histories
* Recovery of real accretion histories
* Reliable real event-age reconstruction
* Resolution of the black-hole information paradox

Instead, the project provides a framework for:

* Observational memory analysis
* Event recoverability measurement
* Memory persistence estimation
* Synthetic-to-real analogue mapping
